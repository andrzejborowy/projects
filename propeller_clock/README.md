I were studying on Warsaw University of Technology. Newar the end of my studies I decided to prepare my diploma. But I didn't want to just describe some problem. It was too obvious. So I choosed to "make a thing" which would work. At that time I was fascinized about proppeler clocks which I have seen in web.
