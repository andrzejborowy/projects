au# Propeller clock

I were studying on Warsaw University of Technology. Newar the end of my studies I decided to prepare my diploma work. I didn't want to just describe some problem. It was too obvious. So I choosed to "make a thing" which would work. At that time I was fascinized about proppeler clocks which I have seen in web. 

It passed couple of years, but I'll try to describe my construction.

## Way of propeller clock works

Fundamentals of propeller clock are based on inertion of human eye. If some point light is moving circle quite fast, there is possibility for human to see this as spinning circle. But speed must to be saved.
If light will comes with some breaks, it will be visible as dots.
Then If we use not one point light bui many of them it is possible to see some fun shapes.
Back to inertion of human eye - there is perfect example of this effect. Newton Circle. This is multi-color circle. With enough high rotation it will become white for observer.

Simplified explanation of how propeller clock works is here:

## Mechanical

I started building propeller clock from the mechanical part. Some of this design was based on my imagination, other part was based on parts that i had.
Construction should have to be simple because main aim of diploma work was to make it working and presenting effect of light, not beauty of mechanics.
Main construction were made of painted black plywood. Others elements were bolted or glued to it.

All models were made in Autodes Inventor 2015.


## Electronics

Electronics part was the biggest part of my diploma work. Because of that I decided to divide this chapter.

### Wireless power supply

When I was designing this clock, one of this problem was to power supply main rotating board. Every motor brush would generate some inertia for spinning so main effect of propeller clock might to not be visible or hard to see with good luck. Because of that I decided to use wireless method of transfering power. First tries were based on transfering power to power supply little light bulb. It was more experimental.

For driving transistor used to generate signal for coil, i used Arduino Mega2560.

I based my construction on fan motor.
