I were studying on Warsaw University of Technology. Newar the end of my studies I decided to prepare my diploma. But I didn't want to just describe some problem. It was too obvious. So I choosed to "make a thing" which would work.
At the end of my studies in 2016 on Warsaw University of Technology I decided do somenthing for my diploma. Not only describe a problem , but made a thing.
